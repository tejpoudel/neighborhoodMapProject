# Project Overview
This is the Udacity Neighborhood Map Project. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare.

## Files
### CSS - Two files make up the CSS files that are local. Bootstrap CSS is CDN based and not local, just easier to update as it is currently using **Bootstrap 4 Alpha**. CSS files indluded:
- `styles.css`

### JS - Only main files are included here:
- `knockout-3.4.2.js` (Knockout framework)
- `app.js` (Main application file)

### HTML - `Index.html` is where all the magic happens and all the data is binded.

### img - This file included images of foursquares powered images.

## Features
You get a full screen Google Map, populated with my Santa Rosa Californi's Public Transportation Stops locations, along with a sidebar with a list of the locations that can be clicked on and see the information about the location.

## APIs
Google Maps API is used here to show the map and generate the markers etc.
Foursquare API is used to pull more information of public Transportation and provide a more complete listing when you click on the marker and the infoWindow shows up.

## Installation
Clone or download this zip file open it and simply open the index.html file and enjoy!
